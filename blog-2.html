and advice, what motivated them, what helped them to get where they are 
today.</p>
<p>Here are nine of their best success lessons (so far!), from them to me to you:</p>
<p><strong>1. You are the sum of the five people you spend the most time with.</strong><br/>
 My mom always used say, “Tell me who your friends are and I’ll tell you
 who you are.” And she was right on—because millionaires surround 
themselves with other millionaires.</p>
<p>If we really are the sum of the people we surround ourselves with, it’s so important to surround yourself with the right ones. Successful people are always networking with each other at events, conferences and mastermind groups.</p>
<p><strong>2. Money in itself won’t make you happy.</strong><br/>
 But money 
can buy you the freedom to do the things that can make you happy. True 
happiness comes from filling your time and your days with meaningful pursuits that you’re passionate about.</p>
<p>I’ve met rich people who are incredibly unhappy and poor people in 
Third World countries who are some of the happiest people I’ve ever 
encountered. The point is that it’s possible to be happy right now, 
whether you have $20 or $20 million. By being grateful for what you 
have, for being alive and for having this day, you’ll be more present 
and have better perspective.</p>
<p><strong>3. “It’s not about the goal. It’s about becoming the type of person that can accomplish the goal,”</strong><br/> the great Tony Robbins said. He probably knows what he’s talking about.</p>
<p>Most millionaires will tell you it’s not so much about making the 
money; it’s about growing as a person, growing your business to a point 
where it’s capable of making money. The journey is far more valuable 
than the destination.</p>
<p>And once you’ve arrived, the question becomes, Now what? That’s why 
it’s so important to enjoy the ride and be grateful for how far you’ve 
come and what you’ve achieved so far.</p>
<p><strong>4. Get a mentor so you can get growing.</strong><br/> Almost every successful person you ask will tell you they had a mentor at some point along the way.</p>
<p>Find someone you admire, look up to—someone who’s where you want to 
be—and ask them for guidance to help you improve who you are and what 
you want to become. With their advice, you’ll learn best practices, 
you’ll be challenged, you’ll be better prepared to succeed.</p>
<p><strong>5. Like to learn.</strong><br/> Every entrepreneur and successful 
person I’ve met is a lifelong learner. They understand the importance of
 constantly improving, constantly growing.</p>
<p>Driven people self-educate through books, audiotapes, online courses,
 seminars…. They’re determined to always learn new skills, to keep 
developing as a person—to never become stagnant. They never stop.</p>
<p><strong>6. Two (or three or four) income sources are better than one.</strong><br/>
 Millionaires know how to put their money and resources to work for 
them. And almost all of them have at least two more sources of 
income—investments in financial securities, real estate, angel 
investing, partnerships.</p>
<p>While multiple sources of income certainly help them increase their 
wealth, they are laser-focused on one income stream first then diversify
 once they’ve hit a level of stability.</p>
<p><strong>7. Hate the gym? Well, learn to hate it a little less.</strong><br/>
 Almost every millionaire I’ve interviewed has some sort of rigorous 
workout routine—weightlifting, marathons and triathlons, running. 
They’re elite in business and at the gym.</p>
<p>There’s a correlation between breaking down barriers in fitness and 
breaking them down in business and in your mind. They’re both about 
strength and confidence, discipline and commitment. Weak won’t cut it. 
So get workin’ on your fitness—and the rest will seem a little less 
daunting.</p>
<p><strong>8. Read—a lot.</strong><br/> I’ve yet to meet a millionaire who doesn’t do a lot of reading. And I’m not talking about <em>Harry Potter</em> or <em>Hunger Games</em>.
 I’m talking books with real, practical tips—for personal and 
professional growth, for people who want to constantly improve 
themselves and their businesses.</p>
<p>Books are a great way to learn from successful people who may have 
been where you are now and have something valuable to teach you. It’s 
like having some of the best business minds of our generation mentor 
you. Read a lot and read often.</p>
<p><strong>9. Write down your experiences.</strong><br/> You don’t have to 
blog to be a millionaire. But it wouldn’t hurt. A lot of successful 
people are getting their start from blogging.</p>
<p>It’s a powerful tool,
 because by documenting your journey and inspirations, you go through a 
sort of self-discovery, while also growing your reputation and business.
 If you’re not ready to share everything on a public blog, try keeping 
handwritten journals instead. The introspective writing process reminds 
you of what you’ve been through and where you want to go. And writing 
down your goals is an incredible way to make sure they happen.</p>
<p><a href="http://success.com/article/10-unforgettable-quotes-by-jim-rohn" target="_blank" title="10 Unforgettable Quotes by Jim Rohn | SUCCESS.com">Jim Rohn said it best</a>:
 “It is challenging to be a student of your own life, your own future, 
your own destiny. Don’t trust your memory. When you listen to something 
valuable, write it down. When you come across something important, write
 it down. Take the time to keep notes and to keep a journal” (or in my 
case, a podcast or blog!).
